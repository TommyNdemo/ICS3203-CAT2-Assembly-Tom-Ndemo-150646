# Assembly Programming Tasks

## Overview

1. **Control Flow and Conditional Logic**:
   Classifies a number as "POSITIVE," "NEGATIVE," or "ZERO" using branching logic.
   
2. **Array Manipulation**:
   Reverses an array in place without additional memory.

3. **Factorial Calculation**:
   Computes the factorial of a number using subroutines and stack operations.

4. **Port-Based Simulation**:
   Simulates a water-level sensor controlling a motor and alarm.

## Instructions

1. **Compile**:
   Use an assembler like `nasm`: nasm -f elf64 <filename>.asm -o <filename>.o ld <filename>.o -o <filename>


2. **Run**:
/<filename>




## Challenges

1. **Task 1**:
- Choosing the appropriate conditional jumps was key to clarity and efficiency.

2. **Task 2**:
- Avoiding extra memory usage made pointer manipulation critical.

3. **Task 3**:
- Managing stack and registers required careful documentation.

4. **Task 4**:
- Simulating real-world hardware control in a simple program posed logical challenges.
